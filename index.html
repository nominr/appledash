        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
          You control a blue player character who begins with three lives. When you encounter an enemy,
          which spawn from the left and right in random configurations, you lose one life. Your goal is to stay alive as long as possible and to collect the most apples possible. These
          statistics are stored in local storage and displayed back to the user.
          As the game progresses, the enemies will continue to spawn faster and increase in number,
          making the game more difficult to play.
          The mouse controls the player's movements from left to right, and to jump, a player can either
          use the spacebar or click the mouse. It is important to note that the character can only move
          if the mouse is in the frame of the game.
